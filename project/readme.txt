--------------------------
This program was written with the intent to complete the requirements outlined in
our Human Computer Interaction Group project.

With a given csv file we are tasked with manipulating the data in several ways.

When the program is run. The given CSV file is edited to remove all missing data (any slot filled with ?)
the file is then split into two different files of sizes 70% and 30%

The code then determines the occurrences of each column in the 70% file as well as the MLE algorithm, to determine the maximum likelihood of humans that make <50k in salary and >=50k in salary annually.

On the 30 percent data the entropy of each column is determined.
The entropy of humans sex is compared between those who make<=50k annually and those who make <50k.
